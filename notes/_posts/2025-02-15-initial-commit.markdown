Hello! Here I will post some notes to document my progress (if any) during self-study of CS336: Language Modeling from Scratch. While these noted are shared in the form of this blog,
please be aware that I am not taking any responsibility if you use anything you find here. This space is for me mostly to keep my thoughts organized and document the process of learning. If you find anything useful here - great!

#### CS336 Language Modeling from Scratch

This is a Stanford University course that guides students through the process of creating a Large Language Model (LLM) from scratch. The lectures and coding assignments are publicly available [here](https://github.com/stanford-cs336/spring2024-lectures/tree/main). While I’m not sure if the on-campus lectures are recorded, the materials available on the website suggest that the lectures consist of executable code, which students follow along with using a debugger. This approach is quite unusual, but after completing the first lecture, I can say that it’s an effective method of study. It allows you to interact with the code directly, examining variables and the application state in real-time.

The first lecture serves as an introduction to the course and provides historical context, helping to build an understanding of the subject while introducing key vocabulary and terms. It then outlines the general framework for creating LLMs, covering everything from gathering raw text data to preparing it in a format that is digestible by a computer. A significant portion of the lecture focuses on explaining how Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) works, as building a BPE Tokenizer is part of the first assignment. The algorithm is presented with a simple example to help develop a deeper intuition. The lecture also discusses different approaches to text tokenization and addresses the question of why tokenization is necessary in the first place. It concludes with some administrative details for on-campus students.

I’ve completed the first part of the first assignment—building the BPE Tokenizer—and I’ll share more on that next time.re next time.
